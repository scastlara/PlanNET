v0.1.0

# Description
Application to explore the different Schmidtea mediterranea predicted interactomes.

At the [Computational Genomics Lab](https://compgen.bio.ub.edu) we have trained a Random Forest classifier to predict planarian protein-protein interactions by using homology inferences (see [link to the published paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btx738/4657068)).
