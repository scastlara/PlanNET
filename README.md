# Version
v0.1.0

# Description
Application to explore the different Schmidtea mediterranea predicted interactomes. Available at [compgen.bio.ub.edu/PlanNET](https://compgen.bio.ub.edu/PlanNET).

At the [Computational Genomics Lab](https://compgen.bio.ub.edu) we have trained a Random Forest classifier to predict planarian protein-protein interactions by using homology inferences (see [link to the published paper](https://compgen.bio.ub.edu)).

> PlanNET was made using Django (https://www.djangoproject.com/), neo4j (https://neo4j.com/) and cytoscape js (http://js.cytoscape.org/).
