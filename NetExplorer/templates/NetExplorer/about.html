    <p>
        <strong>PlanNET</strong> is a web application that stores predicted <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> protein-protein interactions (ppi) projected over a Human ppi network.
         Currently, PlanNET holds 273,203 human ppi, and 729,043 <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> interactions (predicted for 9 different transcriptomes).
    </p>

    <p>
        PlanNET has been developed by the <a href="https://compgen.bio.ub.edu" target="_blank">Computational Genomics Lab</a>, at the University of Barcelona.

    <h3 id="update-notes">Update Notes</h3>
    PlanNET has been updated from version 1.0 (published version at <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/6/1016/4657068" target="_blank">Bioinformatics</a>) to version 1.1.

    These are the most important changes:

    <ul class="update-notes-ul">
        <li>In order to look for homologous proteins for each planarian transcript, we prioritized BLAST instead of EggNOG alignments.</li>
        <li>The RandomForest classifier was refined by filtering the training dataset further, removing interactions not annotated as physical from BioGRID.</li>
        <li>We selected a score cut-off of 0.7 for interactions, instead of the previously used 0.6 cut-off. The Filter Interactions slider in NetExplorer was updated: now it only shows interactions with a score higher than 0.7 by default, but the user can still select other cut-off values</li>
        <li>PlanNET now holds 729,043 Schmidtea mediterranea interactions (up from 510,996).</li>
        <li>The Smed454 dataset and Newmark dataset were temporarily removed because of disk size limitations. These will be uploaded in due time.</li>
        <li>A manually curated list of identifiers for planarian transcripts was uploaded to PlanNET. Now users can search for these identifiers, which follow the form: "Smed_XXX". If a particular transcripts has a manually curated identifier, the identifier will appear in pink both in Gene Search and in the corresponding Gene Card.</li>
        <li>Many quality of life improvements to the overall design of the website, including a search bar in NetExplorer.</li>
    </ul>
