    <h2>About</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <strong>PlanNET</strong> is a web application that stores predicted <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> protein-protein interactions (ppi) projected over a Human ppi network.
         Currently, PlanNET holds 273,203 human ppi, and 729,043 <i>Schmidtea mediterranea</i> interactions (predicted for 9 different transcriptomes).
    </p>

    <p>
        PlanNET has been developed by the <a href="https://compgen.bio.ub.edu" target="_blank">Computational Genomics Lab</a>, at the University of Barcelona.

    <h3>v1.2: January 23rd 2019</h3>
    <ul class="update-notes-ul">
        <li>Schmidtea mediterranea predicted genes (see: <a href="https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/D1/D812/5212006" target="_blank">A. Rozanski et al.</a>) as well as their associated transcripts have been included in PlanNET as SmesGene and Smest respectively.</li>
        <li>Smest gene associated transcripts are now available in the <a href="{% url 'blast' %}">BLAST</a> application.</li>
        <li>A new gene card for Smesgenes has been implemented, with information regarding the associated transcripts across different transcriptomes, the genomic location, gene ontologies and predicted protein-protein interactions.</li>
        <li>Several genomic features (such as mapped transcripts over <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25473" target="_blank">the newly assembled S.med genome</a>) can now be visualized using our new <a href="https://compgen.bio.ub.edu/jbrowse" target="_blank">JBrowse plugin</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="{% url 'planexp' %}">PlanExp</a>, a PlanNET plugin for exploring RNA-seq experiments is available for registered users to test.</li>
        <li>Databases are now identified by node border color instead of shape.</li>
        <li>Node shape in NetExplorer and PathwayFinder now refers to the technology used for sequencing, with triangles reserved for "legacy" technologies such as Sanger and 454, and circles for high-throughput RNA-seq.</li>
        <li>General improvements to design and readability of the application.</li>
    </ul>

    <br>
    <br>

    <h3>v1.1: August 7th 2018</h3>
    PlanNET has been updated from version 1.0 (published version at <a href="https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/6/1016/4657068" target="_blank">Bioinformatics</a>) to version 1.1.

    These are the most important changes:

    <ul class="update-notes-ul">
        <li>In order to look for homologous proteins for each planarian transcript, we prioritized BLAST instead of EggNOG alignments.</li>
        <li>The RandomForest classifier was refined by filtering the training dataset further, removing interactions not annotated as physical from BioGRID.</li>
        <li>We selected a score cut-off of 0.7 for interactions, instead of the previously used 0.6 cut-off. The Filter Interactions slider in NetExplorer was updated: now it only shows interactions with a score higher than 0.7 by default, but the user can still select other cut-off values</li>
        <li>PlanNET now holds 729,043 Schmidtea mediterranea interactions (up from 510,996).</li>
        <li>The Smed454 dataset and Newmark dataset were temporarily removed because of disk size limitations. These will be uploaded in due time.</li>
        <li>A manually curated list of identifiers for planarian transcripts was uploaded to PlanNET. Now users can search for these identifiers, which follow the form: "Smed_XXX". If a particular transcripts has a manually curated identifier, the identifier will appear in pink both in Gene Search and in the corresponding Gene Card.</li>
        <li>New Data Downloader allows users to download sequences and sequence annotations in bulk. Available at <a href="{% url 'downloads' %}" title="Downloads">downloads page</a>.</li>
        <li>Many quality of life improvements to the overall design of the website, including a search bar in NetExplorer.</li>
    </ul>
